Hi there 👋

I'm **LT**, an engineer exploring the intersection of **mechanical engineering** and **software development**. 

💡I'm currently learning **Python** and exploring how programming can be used to automate technical workflows and data analysis in materials and testing.

🧩**What I'm working on**
  -  'Tensile Test Analyzer' - my first Python project: a GUI tool for automated analysis of tensile test data

📘**Next learning goals**
  - Strengthen Python fundamentals
  - Learn to use Pandas and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization
  - Build a small practical project to apply what I learn

🛠️**Background**
  - M. Sc. Mechanical Engineering
  - Research Associate in the field of material science

⚙️**Long-term goal**
  - To combine my engineering background with programming - working on digitalization, automation or data-related tasks in the technical field.
